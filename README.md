Module 15 Challenge

1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
  Task is to visualize an earthquake dataset using the USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site

2: Import and visualize the data by doing the following:
  Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
  Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
  Created a legend that provides context for map data.
  Visualization looks like the example in the challenge.
